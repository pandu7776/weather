## Files

- **weather.html**: The main HTML file for the application.
- **weather.css**: Stylesheet for the application, including animations for different weather conditions.
- **weather.js**: JavaScript file containing functions to fetch weather data and update the UI.

## Setup

1. **API Key**: Replace the `apiKey` in `weather.js` with your own WeatherAPI key.
2. **HTML File**: Open `weather.html` in a web browser to run the application.
3. **User Input**: Enter a location in the input field to get its weather.

## Usage

3. Click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the weather data.

## Known Issues
